.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Amazon EC2
.Dq Nitro
platform exposes disks to virtual machines via the NVM Express protocol.
There are two types of disks so exposed: Elastic Block Store disks, which
persist and can be detached and reattached to different virtual machines,
and Instance Store disks (also known as
.Dq Ephemeral
disks), which exist only while the virual machine is running.
.Pp
Amazon Linux provides a tool
.Dq ebsnvme-id
for identifying the attached Elastic Block Store disks; this
.Nm
is a re-implementation which also exposes some information about Instance
Store disks.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b
Print the
.Dq Linux device name
associated with the specified Elastic Block Store disk.
.It Fl m
Print the Model Number of the disk; this is either
.Dq Amazon Elastic Block Store
or
.Dq Amazon EC2 NVMe Instance Storage
depending on the type of disk.
.It Fl s
Print the Serial Number of the disk.
.It Fl u
Identical to the
.Fl b
option.
.It Fl v
Print
.Dq Volume ID:
followed by the volume ID of the Elastic Block Store disk.

If multiple option are specified, output is printed for each
option, in the order
